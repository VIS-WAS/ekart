        Terms of Service; Didn't Read is a group effort that rates 67 companies'
        terms of service and privacy policies, though its site says the ratings
        are "outdated."[10] It also has browser add-ons that deliver the ratings
        while at the website of a rated company. Members of the group score each
        clause in each terms of service document, but "the same clause can have
        different scores depending on the context of the services it applies
        to."[11]

        The Services tab lists companies in no apparent order, with brief notes
        about significant clauses from each company. In particular, competitors
        are not listed together so that users can compare them. A link gives
        longer notes. It does not typically link to the exact wording from the
        company. The Topics tab lists topics (like "Personal Data" or
        "Guarantee"), with brief notes from some companies about aspects of the
        topic.

        TOSBack.org, supported by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, lists
        changes in terms and policies sequentially, 10 per page, for 160 pages,
        or nearly 1,600 changes, for "many online services."[12] There does not
        seem to be a way to find all changes for a particular company, or even
        which companies were tracked in any time period. It links to Terms of
        Service; Didn't Read, though that typically does not have any evaluation
        of the most recent changes listed at TOSBack.org.
